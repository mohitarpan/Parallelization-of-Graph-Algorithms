## Introduction

Graph algorithms play a crucial role in various domains, including network analysis, social network analysis, and optimization problems. However, the growing size and complexity of real-world graphs pose challenges in terms of computational efficiency. This repository explores the parallelization of graph algorithms as a means to address these challenges.

## Implemented Algorithms

The following graph algorithms have been parallelized:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- PageRank
- Dijkstra's Shortest Path
- Connected Components

Each algorithm is implemented with parallel processing in mind, using techniques such as parallel breadth-first traversal, parallelized priority queues, and efficient data structures for parallel graph processing.

## Usage

Detailed instructions for running each parallelized graph algorithm can be found in their respective directories. Generally, the process involves compiling the source code with a suitable compiler supporting parallelization, configuring input parameters, and executing the parallelized algorithm.

```bash
# Example for running parallel BFS
cd BFS
make
./parallel_bfs input_graph.txt start_vertex
```

## Dependencies

The parallelized graph algorithms may have specific dependencies, such as a parallel programming framework or libraries. Please refer to the documentation within each algorithm's directory for detailed information on dependencies.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for additional parallelized graph algorithms, optimizations, or general improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
